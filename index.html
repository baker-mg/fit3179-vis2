            <h2>Earlier More Crowded Climbs</h2>
            <p>
                The hour at which an expedition summits the mountain has been steadily decreasing over the years.  The descent is the most dangerous part of the climb and climbers prefer to undertake this as soon as possible. <button type="button" class="link" id="time-day-b" onclick="switchTo('time-day-cc')">Summit Times</button>

                The vast majority of climbs occur during the Spring climbing season.  Climbers tend to jump on the first suitable day during their stay to summit Mount Everest.  This leads to a crowded, more dangerous summit and long queues in the Death Zone, the section of the climb above 8000 metres.  A record 314 climbers summitted the mountain on the 23rd of May 2019.<button type="button" class="link" id="summit-date-climbers-b" onclick="switchTo('summit-date-climbers-cc')">Summit Dates</button>.

            <h2>What Dangers Await Climbers?</h2>
            <p>
                There are numerous dangers facing a Mount Everest climber.  The climb can extremely strenuous and exhaustion and exposure a constant worries.  Acute mountain sickness (AMS), a form of altitude sickness, can create symptoms anywhere from headaches to fluid in the lungs or brain swelling.  Avalanches and falls are another worry, a 2014 avalanche claimed the lives of 16 climbers the worst tragedy in Mount Everest history.  <button type="button" class="link" id="death-cause-b" onclick="switchTo('death-cause-cc')">Cause of Death</button>.

            <div id="death-cause-main"></div>
            <p>
                Of the Himalayan peaks Mount Everest has the largest number of deaths.  However this is due to the comparatively large number of people who attempt the climb.  In terms of death rate (deaths divided by attempts) Mount Everest is one of the lower ranked peaks.  <button type="button" class="link" id="peaks-deaths-b" onclick="switchTo('peaks-deaths-cc')">Deaths on Peaks</button>.

            <h2 style="width: 600px;">Who Climbs Mount Everest?</h2>
            <p>
                Approximately 80% of climbers are male, although this percentage has been decreasing over past decades.  Climbers are typically wealthy, the average cost of the trip is 45,000 USD. <br><br>
                The amount of older climbers (those above 50) has been steadily increasing.  This is likely due to an increase in commercialisation and climber assistance measures. <button type="button" class="link" id="age-group-b" onclick="switchTo('age-group-cc')">Age Group of Climbers</button>. <br><br>
                Climbers come from a variety of countries, with the United States, the U.K and Japan being standouts. <button type="button" class="link" id="origin-country-b" onclick="switchTo('origin-country-cc')">Origins of Climbers</button>.
